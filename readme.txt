A privacy-focused, self-hosted analytics dashboard that stores data in your database or text logs.

== Description ==

Privacy-First Analytics Dashboard is a lightweight, modern analytics solution for WordPress. As privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA become stricter, this plugin offers a simple way to track essential metrics without relying on third-party services like Google Analytics.

**Key Features:**

*   **Self-Hosted:** Data stays on your server. Choose between Database storage (optimized) or Text File logs.
*   **Modern Dashboard:** Beautiful React-driven interface using Chart.js.
*   **Performance:** Designed to be lightweight. Database storage is indexed for speed.
*   **No Cookies:** Operates without setting tracking cookies.
